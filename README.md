# Hexapod Project

## Project Description

This project involves the construction and programming of a hexapod robot. The hexapod was designed in Autodesk Inventor, and its parts were printed using a Creality Ender 3 Pro 3D printer. Control is achieved via infrared, with the ability to send signals from any Android app equipped with an infrared transmitter.

## Features

- **Design**: Autodesk Inventor was used for designing individual parts.
- **3D Printing**: Creality Ender 3 Pro 3D printer was used for printing the parts.
- **Control**: Infrared control from an Android mobile app.
- **Programming**: Arduino used for programming the movement logic and control.

## Movement Capabilities

The hexapod is capable of moving in various ways. Below is a list of available walking modes that can be activated through specific infrared signals:

1. **Tetrapod Gait**: A walking mode, in which the robot moves on two legs while standing on four, this mode provides greater movement speed but is less stable.
2. **Wave Gait**: A wave-like walking mode, where legs are lifted and lowered in a wave sequence, allowing for more stable movement.
3. **Right Rotation**: The robot rotates to the right.
4. **Left Rotation**: The robot rotates to the left.
